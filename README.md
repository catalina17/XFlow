Keras code and Digits dataset that can be used to reproduce experiments in:

**Cangea, C.**, Veličković, P. and Liò, P. (2019) **XFlow: Cross-modal Deep Neural Networks for Audiovisual Classification**. To appear in *IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems*. Also presented at the *Workshop on Computational Models for Crossmodal Learning (CMCML) at The 7th Joint IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning and on Epigenetic Robotics (IEEE ICDL-EPIROB 2017)*. [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00572) and the [*ARM Research Summit 2017*](https://developer.arm.com/research/summit/previous-summits/2017/speakers), in the [poster](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ccc53/files/posterXFlow_A1.pdf) session.

The Digits dataset can be downloaded [*here*](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ccc53/files/digits.tar.gz).
